# Template Sync Ignore File
# This file defines which files should be excluded when syncing from the template repository
# Syntax follows glob patterns similar to .gitignore
# Doc: https://github.com/AndreasAugustin/actions-template-sync#ignore-files

# Exclude the ignore.yml playbook from syncing
playbooks/ignore.yml

# Include only specific playbooks by excluding everything else and then allowing specific files
# Note: The action will sync everything by default except what's listed here
# To only sync specific files, you would exclude all and then use negation patterns

# Example: If you wanted to exclude all playbooks except cluster.yml, infrastructure.yml, and services.yml:
# playbooks/*
# !playbooks/cluster.yml
# !playbooks/infrastructure.yml
# !playbooks/services.yml
